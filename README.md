# Silent Firebase Realtime Database Write Failures

This repository demonstrates a bug where Firebase Realtime Database write operations fail silently and inconsistently using the Firebase Admin SDK for Node.js. The issue is intermittent, making debugging challenging.  The provided code shows the problematic write operation and a solution to handle potential failures more robustly.

## Bug Description
Write operations to the Firebase Realtime Database sometimes fail without any error messages, even when database rules allow the write. This is highly problematic because the application has no way of detecting or recovering from these failed writes.

## Solution
The solution involves adding proper error handling to catch potential exceptions during the write operation.  This allows the application to handle failures gracefully, log them for debugging, and potentially retry the operation.
